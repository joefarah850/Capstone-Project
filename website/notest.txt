Considerations for Going Live
To make your application accessible to all users, you'll need to complete the verification process for your app. This involves a review by Google to ensure your app complies with their policies, especially regarding user data and privacy.

Start the Verification Process
Prepare Your Application: Ensure your app complies with Google's API Services User Data Policy, including necessary privacy policies and secure handling of user data.

Initiate the Verification Process:

On the "OAuth consent screen" page in the Google Cloud Console, fill in all the required information about your application.
Ensure that you've set the correct scopes your application needs.
Click on the "Submit for verification" button at the bottom of the page when you're ready.
Follow Up: The verification process might require you to provide additional information or make changes to your application. Google will communicate with you through the contact details provided on the consent screen.

Additional Tips
Scopes: If your app requests sensitive or restricted scopes, the verification process is more stringent. Minimize the requested scopes to only what's necessary for your app's functionality.
Privacy Policy: Your app must have a privacy policy that complies with Google's requirements and is accessible from the OAuth consent screen.
Security Assessment: For apps requesting access to certain sensitive or restricted scopes, a third-party security assessment might be required, which can be costly.

For Production
In a production environment, you must use HTTPS to comply with OAuth 2.0 security requirements. Here are a few steps to achieve this:

Obtain an SSL Certificate: For a live server, you'll need a valid SSL certificate. You can obtain a free certificate from Let's Encrypt or purchase one from another certificate authority.

Configure Your Web Server: Use a production-grade web server like Nginx or Apache to serve your Flask application. Configure the web server to use your SSL certificate, enabling HTTPS.

Update OAuth Redirect URIs: Ensure that the redirect URIs registered in your Google Cloud Console use https and match the URIs used by your application in production.
